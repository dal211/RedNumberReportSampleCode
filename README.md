Red Number Report Documentation Guide

Developed by David Jan-Liu

For inventory management / procurement teams:

- The report is looking a lead time away to see the closest day an inventory out or “short” will occur. Buyer reviews report to analyze if there is a short and reads when the item should be purchased before the predicted short occurs.

Action Items: There are three various features of the report.
- Placing an order in anticipation of a short- If the Red Number Report says there is a short for an item and since the short can be detected within lead time, the buyer should respond by purchasing that short amount
- Rushing a PO- if there is an ad out within lead time and there is an on order where the delivery date is greater than the lead time days of that item, then the on order would obviously not come in time to save the short. In this case, the report would tell the buyer that there is still a short, but the buyer should take action to rush the PO so it gets there in time.
- Appoint the Un-appointed Orders- If there is an ad short and there are incoming un-appointed on orders, the buyer must appoint the on orders so that the on orders can reduce the shorts.
